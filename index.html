    <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
    <p>Today we live in a world that uses digital technology and media to collect, organize, and analyze data about ourselves. In this class, we responded to this datafication with a project that challenged us to learn how to produce digital media and examine how data are integral texts within our everyday communication activities. Accordingly, we were tasked with collecting the data necessary to complete all of the subsequent media projects in the class. To guide this process, we will all share the following broader research questions: How do we participate with algorithmic audiences? How is this participation a form of writing? From there, each of us chose and refined a particular topic as a mode to explore one of your own prominent, networked practices. I decided to look at my Social media use and specifically, how many times a day and for how long I checked social media on my cellphone. My idea was to see if there was a correlation/algorithm with when I checked my social media platforms. Below is a data visualization that correlated with the data I collected for a week.</p>

    <p>During the first phase of the course, we collected and examined a small window into our everyday lives with some digital media or technology. We designed a data visualization that helped us understand and convey something interesting that happened during this period of time. Upon completion of that, we entered the second phase of the course, where we researched and developed content about a broader social issue connected to our everyday digital practices. Writers now write with and for algorithms, and we should understand and learn how people write algorithms to collect and use data about our digital practices.Accordingly, our video explored and explained issues linked to our digital media/technological practice and how corporations and companies commodify such practices. I chose to do my project on data brokering. Data brokering is when a business collects personal information about consumers and sells that information to other organizations. One example I cam across during my data collection phase, is the type of advertisements that were popping up on my Instagram timeline. All of the ads were specifically catered to my interest and this is because of Data brokering.    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Overall, this class taught me a lot of things. I learned that I use social media far too much throughout my day. I learend that I have habits and certain times when I checked my social media almost algorithmically. I learned that what I am doing on social media is being stored and sold to big corporations as a means of specific marketing. I learned how to record data and turn that data into something abstract and aesthetically pleasing. I learned how to make an explained video on a topic that was relevant to my data collection. This class also reinforced my team work skills. Most of all, this class opened my eyes to trying something new. Coding and digital media is something I never would have imagined myself getting involved with, but the class was set up so that even a beginner could get a hang of the process. </p>
